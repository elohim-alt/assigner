# Driver assigner
This is a simple tool to assign the best driver to each of the routes that we need to complete.
The way we define what driver is better suited to complete a route we have an algorithm that calculate the SS for a driver on a certain route. such algorithm can be found under algorithm.py
In order to maximize the total SS we need to decide on a strategy to select the pairings, strategies can be found under 
## running the project
python -m assigner drivers shipments
at this point this is just a placeholder, the instructions will change as the project grows.
